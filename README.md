## UX

### The Strategy Plane


The website is targetted mainly towards proffesionals and businesses. All content on the website has a purpose and is there to answer the questions of any potential employers or clients. The technology used will be fairly simple and straight forward as will the design. 

The aim of the site will be to attract more clients and prospective employers for the proffessional through showcasing their previous work and experience. 

The proffesional has a strong portfolio and career background and this will be portrayed in a clear and concise manner. The website will be informative and simple. 

The target audience is mostly businesses. There are a few websites available such as LinkedIN and Indeed where businesses can find employees and candidates. The purpose of this website is the same, but this is more of an extra for the proffesional which will make them stand out from other potential candidates, as oppose to an alternative.

The site won't list any pricing as this will need to be determined via follow up contact. There needs to be little persuasion as the audience is coming to the website with the intention to fulfil a goal. 

There will be content to ensure the customer, through a contact page. I will a testimonials page along with a portfolio and resume page for this purpose. All these things will add value. 

<!-- Insert picture of User Experience Roadmap 3.40 https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:codeinstitute+FE+2017_T3/courseware/22905698f3be425d918ebc64c87801b7/b8c5816d7e44420082c37dba0ef7723f/ -->

As the website will be sleek and simple and include pictures and multiple points of assurance, it will feel credible and trustworthy. It will offer all the information the prospect clients and potential employers are looking for and any further queries can be address through the contact page which will be simple and easy to use. The contact page also makes it easy for the user to learn more and and contact the proffesional is they need to. 

The home page will be simple and catchy and won't be an eye sore or look too hard to digest. The user will be able to pick up key peices of information through a quick scroll and easily navigate through the site.

#### The target audience for Asma Abu's Resume Website are: 

- Recruiters working in the Tech industry 
- Business owners looking for a developer for their website 
- Any potential clients such as a startup or sole trader looking to develop a website for any purpose 
- Potential Mentee's 

#### The user goals are: 

- Learn more about the proffesional
- Have a look at their past work
- Have any concerns addressed
- To have contact with the developer for any enquiries 
- Learn more about what it's like to work with the proffessional 

##### The budget will vary depending on the project. 

#### The website will meet all the above needs: 

- The website is simple, easy to navigate and most goals will be met through the homepage and where they aren't, there will be multiple points of direction to how they can elsewhere on the website. 


### Business Goals 

- Grow online identity as this is the proffesional's career base
- Attract more clients as the website will make the proffessional stand out from the crowd and give them an identity
- It will establish the brand identity of the individual and the quality of service which will be provided to prospective clients
- Bring more attention and traffic to the proffesional outside of their other Social Media platforms so even if someone visits the site with no purpose, they'll keep the proffesional in mind for future projects
- As the website is devloped by the proffesional it will place trust in the client that they will deliver a good standard of work as displayed
- Provide a means of contact for any prospective employers and clients without them having to go out their way i.e. email or call

## Testing

The site has been testing using the developer tools. 

I have tested all the links on the website to ensure they're working correctly. 
The nav bar is working as it should and works when it is in its full and collapsed state. 
The Footer and all it's links work as they should. 
The contact form works, and all the error messages appear when trying to submit without completing all the fields.
Upon testing, I found if you tried to input the wrong type of data, the form still would submit. I have since updated this and it now is working and verifies as it should. 
The website is simple and looks presentable on all screen sizes.

I experienced an error with the footer of the page. I followed instructions however there's a space between the content and footer which is disguised as margin space so doesn't cause any issues.
